	<description>This application enables Nextcloud to send custom emails to users. By default, Nextcloud can send password reset emails, shared file and share link emails, activity stream notifications and more. By configuring an email server, admins can enable these emails to be sent. By providing an email address on their Personal page, users can receive these emails. By default, all of these emails will contain Nextcloud email templates. The template editor allows admins to change email templates for emails sent by the system.
While it is possible to manually change email templates within Nextcloud, this app makes it far simpler by updating this via the Nextcloud admin panel. More information is available in the Mail template editor documentation.
